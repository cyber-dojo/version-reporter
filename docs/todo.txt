Gitlab Demo

Lead time from commit to aws-prod is going to be ~10min
(or ~7mins if we don't deploy to aws-beta).

If you do each one demo for each of the three test jobs it will take a long time!
You could do all three
  1) snyk vulnerability
  2) missing coverage
  3) no pull-request
in a single commit? Yes.
You could make a pre-recorded video and get JC to cut out the waiting?
These would be great for social media...


Add evidence reporting for binary-provenance
Does this means kosli assert artifact ? Yes.

Add manual-approval step.
What do you mean by this? Do you mean a Kosli approval?
Gitlab manual job
click it
then create kosli approval
Not in the template.

TODO: Rename environments.
The ECS cluster for staging cyber-dojo
The ECS cluster for production cyber-dojo

TODO: Deployment diff not working for version-reporter (on snapshot page)

400 min limit. Mike has bought an extra 1000 mins

snyk needs authenticated account.
IIRC using Sami's...
Still ok for now


cyberdojo/versioner needs cyberdojo/version-reporter:latest
to be what is running in aws-prod.
So add
$ docker tag cyberdojo/version-reporter:$TAG cyberdojo/version-reporter:latest
$ docker push cyberdojo/version-reporter:latest
