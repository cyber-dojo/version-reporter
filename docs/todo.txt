Gitlab Demo

Lead time from commit to aws-prod is going to be ~10min
(or ~7mins if we don't deploy to aws-beta).

If you do each one demo for each of the three test jobs it will take a long time!
You could do all three in one commit
  1) add snyk vulnerability
  2) comment out tests
  3) git push not in pull-request
You could make a pre-recorded video and get JC to cut out the waiting?
These would be great for social media...
