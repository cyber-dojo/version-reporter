The cyberdojo/shas service reports the commit sha used to build
the image for all current cyberdojo services' container.
It is a non-essential service and is deliberately seperated out
into its own independently deployable service so that it can be
the service used to test changes to the deployment pipeline.
For example, when there is a Helm chart upgrade.
